1. Each univariate function is of the type x*exp(-x^i) for integer i. So, from 0 to the maximal point, it is increasing, and after that decreasing.
This information is given as input to the Dexter code.

2. For node relaxation, we round down the state values to its floor.

3. For continuous case, we use 30 grids for arc relaxation.

4. For subgradient, we use 20 iterations. After finding violation, we continue the algorithm for extra 20 iterations.
